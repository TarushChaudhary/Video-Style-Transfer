1. Optical Flow Estimation
Choose an Optical Flow Method: Use a robust optical flow estimation method like RAFT for accurate flow fields.

Integrate Optical Flow into the Pipeline: Implement a function to estimate the flow between consecutive frames.

2. Initialization with Warped Previous Frame
Modify the Training Loop: Process frames sequentially, using the stylized previous frame as the initialization for the current frame.

Warp the Previous Stylized Frame: Use the estimated optical flow to warp the previous stylized frame to the current frame's coordinate system.

3. Temporal Consistency Loss
Add Temporal Loss Term: Include a loss term that penalizes deviations between the current frame and the warped previous frame.

Exclude Disocclusions and Motion Boundaries: Use masks to exclude regions with disocclusions and motion boundaries from the temporal loss.

Handling Disocclusions and Motion Boundaries
Detect Disocclusions: Use forward-backward flow consistency to identify disoccluded regions.

Detect Motion Boundaries: Use gradient-based methods to detect motion boundaries.

Multi-Pass Algorithm
Implement Forward and Backward Passes: Process the video in alternating directions to propagate style information consistently.

Blend Results: Combine forward and backward passes to avoid artifacts near image boundaries.

Long-Term Consistency (Optional)
Incorporate Long-Term Loss: Add loss terms that compare the current frame with frames several steps back to maintain style consistency over time.
